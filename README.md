## üëâ Live Demo: https://reacher.email

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/saasify-uploads-prod/696e287ad79f0e0352bc201b36d701849f7d55e7.svg" height="68" align="left" />

This is open-source, but I also offer a **SaaS** solution that has `check-if-email-exists` packaged in a nice friendly web interface. If you are interested, find out more at [Reacher](https://reacher.email/?ref=github). If you have any questions, you can contact me at amaury@reacher.email.

<br />

## Get Started

3 non-SaaS ways to get started with `check-if-email-exists`.

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è HTTP backend using Docker (popular method ü•á) [[Full docs](./backend/README.md)]

This option allows you to run a HTTP backend using Docker üê≥, on a cloud instance or your own server. Please note that outbound port 25 must be open.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 reacherhq/backend:latest
```

Then send a `POST http://localhost:8080/v0/check_email` request with the following body:

```js
{
    "to_email": "someone@gmail.com",
    "from_email": "my@my-server.com", // (optional) email to use in the `FROM` SMTP command, defaults to "user@example.org"
    "hello_name": "my-server.com",    // (optional) name to use in the `EHLO` SMTP command, defaults to "localhost"
    "proxy": {                        // (optional) SOCK5 proxy to run the verification through, default is empty
        "host": "my-proxy.io",
        "port": 1080,
        "username": "me",             // (optional) Proxy username
        "password": "pass"            // (optional) Proxy password
    },
    "smtp_port": 587                  // (optional) SMTP port to do the email verification, defaults to 25
}
```

### 2. Download the CLI [[Full docs](./cli/README.md)]

> Note: The CLI binary doesn't connect to any backend, it checks the email directly from your computer.

Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists/releases) and download the binary for your platform.

```bash
> $ check_if_email_exists --help
check_if_email_exists 0.9.1
Check if an email address exists without sending an email.

USAGE:
    check_if_email_exists [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [TO_EMAIL]
```

Check out the [dedicated README.md](./cli/README.md) for all options and flags.

### 3. Programmatic Usage [[Full docs](https://docs.rs/check-if-email-exists)]

In your own Rust project, you can add `check-if-email-exists` in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
check-if-email-exists = "0.9"
```

And use it in your code as follows:

```rust
use check_if_email_exists::{check_email, CheckEmailInput, CheckEmailInputProxy};

async fn check() {
    // Let's say we want to test the deliverability of someone@gmail.com.
    let mut input = CheckEmailInput::new(vec!["someone@gmail.com".into()]);

    // Verify this email, using async/await syntax.
    let result = check_email(&input).await;

    // `result` is a `Vec<CheckEmailOutput>`, where the CheckEmailOutput
    // struct contains all information about our email.
    println!("{:?}", result);
}
```

The reference docs are hosted on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/check-if-email-exists).

## ‚úàÔ∏è JSON Output

The output will be a JSON with the below format, the fields should be self-explanatory. For `someone@gmail.com` (note that it is disabled by Gmail), here's the exact output:

```json
{
	"input": "someone@gmail.com",
	"is_reachable": "invalid",
	"misc": {
		"is_disposable": false,
		"is_role_account": false
	},
	"mx": {
		"accepts_mail": true,
		"records": [
			"alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.",
			"gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.",
			"alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.",
			"alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.",
			"alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com."
		]
	},
	"smtp": {
		"can_connect_smtp": true,
		"has_full_inbox": false,
		"is_catch_all": false,
		"is_deliverable": false,
		"is_disabled": true
	},
	"syntax": {
		"domain": "gmail.com",
		"is_valid_syntax": true,
		"username": "someone",
		"suggestion": null
	}
}
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

#### What does `is_reachable: "unknown"` mean?

This means that the server does not allow real-time verification of an email right now. It may happen for multiple reasons: your IP is blacklisted, the SMTP port 25 is blocked, the email account is momentarily receiving too many emails (spam protection)... or the email provider simply does not allow real-time verification at all. The details of this `"unknown"` case can be found in the `smtp.error` and `mx.error` fields.

#### The library hangs/takes a long time/doesn't show anything after 1 minute.

Most ISPs block outgoing SMTP requests through port 25, to prevent spam. `check-if-email-exists` needs to have this port open to make a connection to the email's SMTP server, so won't work behind these ISPs, and will instead hang until it times out. There's unfortunately no easy workaround for this problem, see for example [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18139102/how-to-get-around-an-isp-block-on-port-25-for-smtp). One solution is to rent a Linux cloud server with a static IP and no blocked ports, see for example our [Self-Host Guide](https://help.reacher.email/self-host-guide) for which cloud providers open port 25.

To see in detail what the binary is doing behind the scenes, run it in verbose mode with `RUST_LOG=debug` to see the logs.
